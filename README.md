##A Gallifreyan Alphabet translator

###Status

Not finished at all :P
Status: 30%-ish. Only consonant lines are needed to be fully readable!

###About

You can view the site at: https://gallifreyan-translator.herokuapp.com/
The project's purpose is to quickly create complex and customizable Gallifreyan words/sentences, without the need for image processing tools.

###About the language

The Circular Gallifreyan Alphabet is a fictional language inspired by the Doctor Who TV series. It was created by Loren Sherman.

TODO:
- add consonant lines
- make them movable
- support for doubled vowels/consonants
- make the canvas and contents scalable
- redo the selection system
- clean up the code
- improve the interface
...
- multiple words
- support for punctuation, numbers?

(and probably lots of small stuff that I didn't even think about as it's my first web app project)
