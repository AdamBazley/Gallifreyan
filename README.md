##A Gallifreyan Alphabet translator

###Status

Not finished at all :P
Status: 50%-ish. Only consonant lines are needed to be fully readable!

###About

You can view the site at: http://adrian17.github.io/Gallifreyan/
The project's purpose is to quickly create complex and customizable Gallifreyan words/sentences, without the need for image processing tools.

###About the language

The Circular Gallifreyan Alphabet is a fictional language inspired by the Doctor Who TV series. It was created by Loren Sherman.

TODO:
- improve line logic
- support for doubled vowels/consonants
- manual addition/deletion of lines
- make the canvas and contents scalable
- clean up the code
- improve the interface
...
- multiple words
- support for punctuation, numbers?

(and probably lots of small stuff that I didn't even think about as it's my first web app project)
