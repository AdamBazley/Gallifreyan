TODO:
- support for doubled vowels/consonants
- manual addition/deletion of lines
- make the canvas and contents scalable
- clean up the code
- improve the interface
...
- multiple words
- support for punctuation, numbers?

(and probably lots of small stuff that I didn't even think about as it's my first web app project)
